# Verification Practice: Simple CPU Verification
## Hello!

Below is my self-motivated attempt at verifiying an extremely simple CPU.

My goal was to use a super simple CPU to understand how Systemverilog, UVM, SVA, functional coverage and other verification methodologies work in concert.

I will next work on a more complex project, likely verifying parts of the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) Core.

Before doing so, I am seeking feedback:
Do you see anything that is absolutely awful?
Are there other concepts or methodologies I should consider learning to become a more competitive applicant?
Is this a reasonable approach?
Is the BOOM core a good project?

All input is much appreciated.  Thank you!

## Simple CPU
This CPU is from a Cadence "systemverilog for design" course.  I used the RTL only, but built the testbench entirely myself.

## EDA Playground Simulations
I use EDA playground as I do not have access to commercial simulators:
