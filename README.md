# Verification Practice Project #1: Simple CPU

## Hello!

I am hoping for feedback on my below self-assigned verification project.  

**The plan:** complete a set of self-assigned verification projects, to produce a 'verification portfolio' (or verification plans and testbenches) to be used to apply for entry level verification positions.

**The project:** This is the first such project. I used an extremely simple CPU to create a verification plan, build a testbench in EDAplayground, and execute the plan.

**The goal:** to build my understanding of how verification tools work together (SV, UVM, SVA, functional coverage, etc.), before attempting a more complex project.

**The ask:** I am looking for feedback.
  1. Do you have any criticism of the verification plan or testbenches below?  Absolutely all criticism appreciated.
  2. Do you think building projects is a reasonable approach to landing an entry level DV engineering role?  
  3. Are there any skills, methodologies or architectures my next project could incorporate to demonstrate I have the drive and potential to contribute as an entry-level DV engineer?  I am still scoping the next project, but plan to use UC Berkleyâ€™s OoO risc-v BOOM core to learn build something more resuable at the block and system level. 

All input is much appreciated.  Thank you!

## EDA Playground Simulations

I work within EDA playground, as I do not have access to commercial simulators and there is no EDAPlayground/Github sync.

## Simple CPU

This CPU RTL comes from a Cadence "Systemverilog for Design" course.  I used the RTL, but built the testbench myself.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps

* TB reusability is key; even with such a simple design, a huge percentage of time was reprogamming the same components for different IP blocks.
* Consistency in naming at interfaces seems critical for reusability.
* Plan to try to implement assertions in checker module.
* Need to improve SVA skills, they are marginal.
