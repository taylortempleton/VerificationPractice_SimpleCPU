# Verification Practice Project #1: Simple CPU

## Hello!

I am hoping for feedback on my below self-assigned verification project.  

**The plan:** Complete a series of verification projects, to be used to apply for entry-level verification positions.

**The project:** Verify a simple CPU.  Draft a block-level vplan, build a SV/UVM testbench in EDAPlayground, and execute the plan.

**The project goal:** Develop an understanding of how verification tools and concepts work together (SV, UVM, SV Assertions, functional coverage, etc.), before attempting more complex projects.

**The ask:** I am looking for feedback.
  1. Do you have any criticism of the below project?
  2. Do you think building verification projects is a reasonable approach to landing an entry level DV engineering role?  

I will next to verify the data and control paths of a pipelined CPU (OpenHWâ€™s 4-stage in-order risc-v cv32e40p core, still using EDAPlayground), to improve my verification skills and understanding of CPU architecture. 

All input is much appreciated.  Thank you!

## EDA Playground Simulations

*I work within EDA playground, as I do not have access to commercial simulators and there is no EDAPlayground/Github sync.  
*Unfortunately, EDA Playground itself is often laggy. All sims last confirmed functional as-is 5/30.

## Verilator Simulations

(*In progress. ECD 6/17)


## Verification Plan

I created my verification plan guided by the resources cited at bottom.

## Testbench Architecture

I created my testbench architecture guided by the resources cited at bottom.

## Simple CPU

This CPU RTL comes from a Cadence "Systemverilog for Design" course.  I used the RTL, but built the testbench myself.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps

* TB reusability is key; even with such a simple design, a huge percentage of time was reprogamming the same components for different IP blocks.
* Consistency in naming at interfaces seems critical for reusability.
* Plan to try to implement assertions in checker module.
* Need to improve SVA skills, they are marginal.
